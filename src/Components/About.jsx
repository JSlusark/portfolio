					<p>
						While growing up, I was consistently drawn to gaming, digital art,
						and the creation of my own digital experiences. This ranged from
						personalizing blogs to designing graphics and crafting my own games
						using tools like RPG Maker and Ren'Py.
					</p>
					<p>
						My passion for tech naturally led me into a career where I
						collaborated closely with developers, supporting and guiding their
						endeavors with data insights, advertising solutions, trend analysis,
						and user experience practices. My strength lies in effectively
						communicating and understanding the development landscape, which
						propelled my career as a tech sales executive. However, as I delved
						deeper into my profession, I realized that my true interest was in
						the development of the services I sold, understanding how they were
						constructed and considering how they could be improved. This
						realization inspired me to shift my focus towards becoming a web
						developer.
					</p>
					<p>
						After gaining some foundational knowledge from online resources and
						a part-time introductory course at SheCodes, I fully committed to my
						new path by enrolling in a comprehensive 6-month Full-Stack web
						development program at CareerFoundry.
