  "about": "While growing up I was often exposed to technology. Commodore 64 was my first love and from there it followed a life of videogaming, mastering Photoshop graphical skills, creating blogs and daydreaming about creating my first visual novel game in Renpy. My curiosity towards tech led me to a career into mobile gaming, where I would lead and advise mobile game companies on optimizing their projects with various products and services (analytics, game engines, in-game advertising methods, art assets, playtesting etc..). During this time I learnt a lot about game and app development, my fascination grew until it culminated in a shift to Software engineering in 2023. My journey can be observed from the timeline and CV below.",
