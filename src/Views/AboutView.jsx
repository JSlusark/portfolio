          <p>
            While growing up, I was consistently drawn to gaming, digital art,
            and the creation of my own digital experiences. This ranged from
            personalizing blogs to designing graphics and crafting my own games
            using tools like RPG Maker and Ren'Py.
          </p>

            My passion for tech naturally led me into a career where I
            collaborated closely with developers, supporting and guiding their
            endeavors with data insights, advertising solutions, trend analysis,
            and user experience practices. My strength lies in effectively
            communicating and understanding the development landscape, which
            propelled my career as a tech sales executive. However, as I delved
            deeper into my profession, I realized that my true interest was in
            the development of the services I sold, understanding how they were
            constructed and considering how they could be improved. This
            realization inspired me to shift my focus towards becoming a web
            developer.

            After gaining some foundational knowledge from online resources and
            a part-time introductory course at SheCodes, I fully committed to my
            new path by enrolling in a comprehensive 6-month Full-Stack web
            development program at CareerFoundry.
