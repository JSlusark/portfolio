              While growing up I was often exposed to technology. Commodore 64
              was my first love and from there it followed a life of
              videogaming, mastering Photoshop graphical skills, creating blogs
              and daydreaming about creating my first visual novel game in
              Renpy. My curiosity towards tech led me to a career into mobile
              gaming, where I would lead and advise mobile game companies on
              optimizing their projects with various products and services
              (analytics, game engines, in-game advertising methods, art assets,
              playtesting etc..). During this time I learnt a lot about game and
              app development, my fascination grew until it culminated in a
              shift to Software engineering in 2023. My journey can be observed
              from the timeline and CV below.
